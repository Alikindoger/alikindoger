## Hi there 👋

# I'm Alikindoger, a computer science student based in Seville.

I've done some projects, but the most I like are games!

I've used Unity in the past, but now I'm using godot (and I'm loving it! <3)
I love using blender too.

I'm looking to colaborate in any type of project and I'm looking forward to learn a lot.

You can reach me on my email.
